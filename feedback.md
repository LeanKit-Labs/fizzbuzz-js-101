# Feedback - LeanKit Fizzbuzz Screen

Just some thoughts I had on how the instructions for the challenge could be more clear. It may be that you're leaving them deliberately vague to see what people do which is why I haven't just submitted an issue.

* It isn't clear whether index.html can be modified to load fizzbuzz.js or if you're specifically looking for people to load it dynamically.
* It also isn't clear what the fizzbuzz function should do when none of your 4 specs are met. There are a few obvious options, and I wasn't sure if you really cared about a specific one.
